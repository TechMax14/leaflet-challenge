# Leaflet Challenge (HW12)

This repository contains code and data for a homework assignment focused on using Leaflet to create an interactive map displaying earthquake data. The dataset used in this project reflects all earthquake recordings from the last 30 days and is sourced from the [USGS Earthquake Hazards Program](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).

## Contents

- The code for the homework submission can be found in the `leaflet-part-1` folder.

## Data Source

The earthquake data used in this project is available in GeoJSON format and can be accessed through the following URL:
- [JSON Data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson)

## Description

This project utilizes Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps, to visualize earthquake data. The earthquakes are represented as circles on the map, with their size indicating magnitude and color indicating depth. A legend is provided to help interpret the depth levels.

## Instructions

To view the interactive map and explore the earthquake data, open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.
